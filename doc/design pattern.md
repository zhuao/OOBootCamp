###Creational design patterns

This design patterns is all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.


1. Abstract Factory
	
	Creates an instance of several families of classes   
1. Builder

	Separates object construction from its representation.  *cover object complex construction. desc by zhuao*
1. Factory Method

	Creates an instance of several derived classes
1. Object Pool
	
	Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
1. Prototype

	A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
1. Singleton

	A class of which only a single instance can exist

###Structural design patterns

This design patterns is all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

1. Adapter

	Match interfaces of different classes
	* wrap an exsiting class with a new interface
	* convert an old component with a new system
1. Bridge
	
	Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
1. Composite

	A tree structure of simple and composite objects.
	* recrusive composition
	* Directory contains entries, each of which would would be a directory.
1. Decorator

	Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
1. Facade
	
	Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
1. Flyweight

	A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
1. Private Class Data

	Restricts accessor/mutator access
1. Proxy
	
	An object representing another object

###Behavioral design patterns

This design patterns is all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.


1. Chain of responsibility
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
1. Command
Encapsulate a command request as an object
1. Interpreter
A way to include language elements in a program
1. Iterator
Sequentially access the elements of a collection
1. Mediator
Defines simplified communication between classes
1. Memento
Capture and restore an object's internal state
1. Null Object
Designed to act as a default value of an object
1. Observer
A way of notifying change to a number of classes
1. State
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
1. Strategy
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
1. Template method
Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
1. Visitor
Defines a new operation to a class without change
